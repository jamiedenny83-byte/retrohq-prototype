# RetroHQ — start here for the next development chat

Last updated: 2026-10-11 (Europe/London).

**Uploaded implementation:** `003875c575efd4d61079cfbdfc5d441b725f61c4` on `retrohq-test-8.3`. Both push and PR Linux CI runs passed. A subsequent documentation-only completion commit records these results; inspect the current remote tip before changing it. Live Codespace acceptance is still pending.

## Current work
Milestone 8.4 implementation: read-only eBay Sandbox sales import and inventory reconciliation. See [test notes](TEST_8_4_NOTES.md) for actual functionality, limitations, update instructions and acceptance checks; see [work log](WORK_LOG.md) for verification/upload results. Do not mark live acceptance complete solely because offline tests pass.

Repository: `jamiedenny83-byte/retrohq-prototype`.
Working branch: `retrohq-test-8.3` (contains the 8.4 build; the branch name is retained for compatibility).
Open draft PR #47 targets 8.2. Do not merge until the user approves. Older PR #15 is unrelated to this increment. Issues #50/#51 define the roadmap.

## Preserved checkpoints
- `retrohq-rollback-8.3-verified` at `887f40d13b1bf450ae458c5140b3a053e64ec872`: verified CeX/Seller baseline.
- `retrohq-rollback-before-8.4` at `34399a0da48c4a3d02f8d3384582c047f6ddaf58`: exact starting tip including early order-reader work.

## User-confirmed facts
- CeX is working; Silent Hill 2 PS2 was successfully tested.
- Seller OAuth Sandbox was tested successfully in the existing Codespace.
- Keep the existing Codespace. Changing it previously changed the callback URL and broke eBay authorisation.
- The user wants ongoing development called `current` if safe. Rename has NOT been performed because PR #47 uses the existing branch as its head and local Codespace state is unverified.
- The user explicitly requested persistent summaries of chats, decisions and workload. Update these files at each handover.

## Next actions / workload
1. Check WORK_LOG.md for final test and upload evidence, then inspect remote branch state before continuing.
2. User runs the 8.4 Sandbox acceptance checks in the existing Codespace. The current local session did not inspect or modify its secrets, token file, checkout or running server.
3. Collect acceptance results and any failed order examples with buyer data removed. Keep issues #50/#51 open until actual acceptance.
4. Resolve a rename plan for `current` only after checking the existing Codespace's clean status, branch tracking and PR #47 disposition. Do not create another Codespace. Include a transition plan for the old remote name and CI filters.
5. Schedule 8.5 only after 8.4 acceptance: history, ageing, priorities, bulk buys, profit and inventory accuracy. 8.6+ remains reassessment.

## Continuity limitations
The old chats were only partially retrievable: assistant messages appeared as content-reference placeholders. Do not claim full access to them. The GitHub roadmap and user's confirmation supplied the reliable scope. This repository now holds the ongoing handover; no credentials or full private chat transcripts belong here.
